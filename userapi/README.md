## 1. Web Application Development
- **Programming Language and Framework:** NodeJS with Express
- **Database:** Redis
- **Tests:** Unit, API, configuration, connection tests

## 2. CI/CD Pipeline

| Aspect                   | Details                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Platform                 | GitHub Actions                          |
| Deployment Platform      | Azure                                   |

- **Pipeline Steps:** 
  - Unit Tests
  - Build Docker Image
  - Push Docker Image to Docker Hub
  - Deploy to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
  - Run API Tests

## 3. Dockerization
- **Dockerfile:** installation and launching of NODE
- **Docker Hub Repository:** [matheogonnet/devops-project-image](https://hub.docker.com/r/matheogonnet/devops-project-image)

## 4. Docker Compose Orchestration
- **docker-compose.yml:** Integration of Redis and orchestration of the app

## 5. Kubernetes Orchestration
- **Kubernetes Cluster:** Setup using Minikube
- **Manifest Files:** 
  - deployment.yaml for deploying the application with Docker
  - service.yaml for exposing the application as a service
  - pv.yaml for persistent volume of the application
  - pvc.yaml for claiming the persistent volume
