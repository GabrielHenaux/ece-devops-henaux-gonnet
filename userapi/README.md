## 1. Web Application Development
- **Programming Language and Framework:** NodeJS with Express
- **Database:** Redis
- **Tests:** Unit, API, configuration, connection tests


## 2. REST API Usage
Our project includes a RESTful API for user management. Here's how to use it:

- **Base URL:** `http://localhost:3000`
- **Endpoints:**
  - `POST /user`: Create a new user. Requires a JSON payload with `username`, `firstname`, and `lastname`.
  - `GET /user/:username`: Retrieve details of a user by their username.
  - `PUT /user/:username`: Update details of an existing user. The JSON payload can include `newUsername`, `firstname`, and/or `lastname`.
  - `DELETE /user/:username`: Delete a user by their username.

- **Using the API:**
  - Use HTTP clients like Postman or command-line tools like curl to send requests to these endpoints.
  - Ensure to set the `Content-Type` header to `application/json` for requests that require a payload.
  - Interpret HTTP response codes and payloads to understand the outcome of your requests.
  - You can also access directly the [User Management](#2-using-the-user-management-interface) page to use the REST API with all the CRUD methods. /!\ The API is not available on the website when it is deployed on Azure due to the fact that the API is not exposed to the outside world (routing is different on Azure).


## 3. Using the User Management Interface
To manage users through the web interface (use the REST API directly from the web interface):

- **Access the Interface:** Open the website and navigate to the 'User Management' tab.
- **Create a User:** 
  - Fill out the 'Create User' form with the user's username, first name, and last name.
  - Click the 'Create' button to add the new user.
- **Search for a User:** 
  - Enter a username in the 'Get User' form.
  - Click the 'Search' button to retrieve and display the user's details.
- **Update User Information:** 
  - In the 'Update User' form, enter the old username and the new details (new username, first name, last name).
  - Click 'Update' to apply the changes.
- **Delete a User:** 
  - Enter the username in the 'Delete User' form.
  - Click the 'Delete' button to remove the user from the system.


## 4. CI/CD Pipeline

| Aspect                   | Details                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Platform                 | GitHub Actions                          |
| Deployment Platform      | Azure                                   |

- **Pipeline Steps:** 
  - Unit Tests
  - Build Docker Image
  - Push Docker Image to Docker Hub
  - Deploy to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
  - Run API Tests

## 5. Dockerization
- **Dockerfile:** installation and launching of NODE
- **Docker Hub Repository:** [matheogonnet/devops-project-image](https://hub.docker.com/r/matheogonnet/devops-project-image)

## 6. Docker Compose Orchestration
- **docker-compose.yml:** Integration of Redis and orchestration of the app

## 7. Kubernetes Orchestration
- **Kubernetes Cluster:** Setup using Minikube
- **Manifest Files:** 
  - deployment.yaml for deploying the application with Docker
  - service.yaml for exposing the application as a service
  - pv.yaml for persistent volume of the application
  - pvc.yaml for claiming the persistent volume


## 8. Istio configuration

Istio is a powerful service mesh that provides us with a way to control how microservices communicate with each other. It offers advanced traffic management capabilities, security features, and observability into our application's communication patterns. In our project, Istio is used to inject sidecars into Kubernetes pods, which then manage traffic flow, enforce policies, and collect telemetry data. This enables features like intelligent routing, traffic shifting between different versions of a service, and enhanced monitoring.

To leverage Istio in our environment, users should be aware of key Istio components such as VirtualServices for defining fine-grained traffic routing rules, DestinationRules for configuring what happens to traffic after routing, and Gateways for managing external access to our services. Users can interact with these configurations to control the traffic flow, perform canary deployments, and gain insights into the application's performance and behavior. For example, by altering VirtualService configurations, users can shift traffic between different service versions to test new features in a controlled manner.

Our setup includes detailed configurations of these components, allowing for sophisticated traffic management and monitoring capabilities, enriching our DevOps practices and providing a robust platform for our microservices architecture.

Istio is already insstallled on the app. However if there is a problem on your machine, please insatll istio. 
Once you have istio installed, you can use the port-forwarding by using the following command on a new terminal:

kubectl port-forward svc/devops-project-service 8080:80 -n app-namespace

After you can just curl or access the app and istio
